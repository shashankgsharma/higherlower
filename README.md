# higherlower
The higher-lower game wants the user to guess a particular number between the range of 1 - 100, having a fixed number of attempts, based on the chosen level by the user.
Easy level has 10 attempts, Hard level has 5 attempts, the level is easy by default.
This was a relatively easy project compared to the previous projects in #100DaysOfPython course of Angela Yu.

Kindly spare thoughts for any modifications.
Thanks, 
Shashank Sharma.
